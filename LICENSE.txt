We have copied the license statement from the authors of PyStackReg (https://pystackreg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/readme.html#license) as we felt it summarized the usage requirements well:

You are free to use this software for commercial and non-commercial
purposes. However, we expect you to include a citation or acknowledgement
whenever you present or publish research results that are based
on this software. You are free to modify this software or derive
works from it, but you are only allowed to distribute it under the
same terms as this license specifies. Additionally, you must include
a reference to the research paper below in all software and works
derived from this software.

(DOI link to paper will be shown here when published)

We would also like to mention the CRAPL, a self-described "academic-strength open source license" (https://matt.might.net/articles/crapl/), as a brief read which says nothing about the users' legal obligations but captures the spirit of this unpolished, academic code pipeline built on many Python packages developed by others.
